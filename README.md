# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser
An algorithm visualiser made using the pygame library

CONTROLS:
Space -> Generates random list & displays
Return -> Visualises given algorithm (Selection Sort)

I challenged myself to make an algorithm visualiser completely from scratch.
With my previous knowledge of pygame creating the 2v2-Pygame-Shooter, I 
created a sorting algorithm visualiser without using any resources.

I implemented selection sort, however, I programmed it to be interchangeable 
with any sorting algorithm.

The script is modular, so you can adjust any of the global values
to adjust the script however be aware of pygame's limitations.
