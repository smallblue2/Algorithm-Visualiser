# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser
An algorithm visualiser made using the pygame library

I challenged myself to make an algorithm visualiser completely from scratch.
With my previous knowledge of pygame creating the 2v2-Pygame-Shooter, I 
created a sorting algorithm visualiser without using any resources.

I implemented selection sort, however, I programmed it to be interchangeable 
with any sorting algorithm.

The script is modular, so you can adjust any of the global values
to adjust the script.
